Project Description

The Quotes Generator is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to explore inspiring quotes with just a click. By entering a number or simply pressing the Generate button, the app fetches a specific quote from an API and displays it in a clean and attractive format. The project combines simplicity with usefulness, offering daily motivation through meaningful words.
